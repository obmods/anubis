A dispute will be refused if its contents are illegal, or if it presents a conflict of interest for the moderator. In rare cases, the moderator may refuse the dispute for another reason and then add that reason to these Terms & Conditions.

If refused, the buyer and vendor will be left to sort out the transaction themselves, until OpenBazaar provides a mechanism to transfer moderators.

#### Illegal Items

The moderator refuses to arbitrate products or services which are illegal to sell in the vendor's territory, illegal to buy in the buyer's territory, or illegal to arbitrate in the moderator's territory. If in question, each party is responsible for demonstrating that their role in the transaction is lawful.

#### Conflicts of Interest

A conflict of interest arises if a party has one of the following relationships to the moderator:

- Business partner
- Employer or employee
- Stakeholder
- Close friend or relative
- Government entity with jurisdiction over the moderator
- Same entity as moderator

A party must reveal any evidence for a conflict of interest as soon as possible during a dispute.

A dispute will be refused if its contents are on [the blacklist](/blacklist.md). In rare cases, the moderator may refuse the dispute for another reason and then add that reason to these Terms & Conditions.

If refused, the buyer and vendor will be left to sort out the transaction themselves, until OpenBazaar provides a mechanism to transfer moderators.

#### Blacklist

An [accompanying document](/blacklist.md) lists the products, services, and entities for which the moderator refuses to arbitrate. Vendors are responsible for checking their listings against it while the moderator is offered on their stores.
